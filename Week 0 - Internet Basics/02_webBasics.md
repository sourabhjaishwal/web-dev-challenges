# Web Development Overview

## 1. What is the Web and How Does the Web Work?

The web is a system of interlinked documents and multimedia accessible over the Internet. It works through browsers, which interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages.

**Example**: A web server serves HTML files that are rendered in browsers.

## 2. What Are Browsers and How Do They Render Websites?

A Browser is a software application used to access and view websites. It fetches resources from web servers and renders them on the screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Example**: Browsers like Chrome or Firefox convert HTML into a viewable webpage.

## 3. What is the Purpose of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web.
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML content, defining layout and appearance.
- **JavaScript** is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

**Example HTML**:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

**Example CSS**:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

**Example JS:**

```js
alert("Hello, world!");
```

## 4. What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) technologies to create interactive, dynamic websites.

**Example:** Creating a shopping cart system for an e-commerce website.

## 5. Different Versions of the Web

**Web 1.0:** The static web, where content is read-only.

**Web 2.0:** The interactive web, where users can contribute and interact with content (social media, blogs).

**Web 3.0:** The semantic web, focusing on personalized and decentralized experiences, often using AI and blockchain.

## 6. Frontend vs Backend vs Full Stack Development

Frontend Development: Involves the design and user interface of a website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Backend Development: Focuses on server-side operations and database management (Node.js, Python, Ruby).

Full Stack Development: Combines both frontend and backend, allowing developers to build entire web applications.

**Example:** A full-stack developer might use React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
