# Internet Basics

## 1. What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of computers and servers that communicate with each other using protocols like TCP/IP, allowing for the exchange of data and information.
It connects millions of devices, enabling services such as the World Wide Web, email, file sharing, and more.

## 2. How Does the Internet Work?

The Internet works by using a combination of hardware and protocols to facilitate data transfer between computers. Devices connect to each other via routers, switches, and data centers using TCP/IP protocols.

**Example:** When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a server, which responds by sending back the requested data.

## 3. List of Common Internet Terminologies

**IP Address:** A unique address assigned to each device connected to the internet.

**Router:** A device that forwards data between networks.

**Protocol:** A set of rules for communication, such as HTTP or FTP.

**Packet:** A unit of data that travels across the network.

**Firewall:** A system that filters traffic and protects from unauthorized access.

## 4. What is a URL?

**Syntax Example:** https://www.example.com/page1

## 5. What is HTTPS vs HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an insecure protocol used for transmitting web pages. It does not encrypt data.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data using SSL/TLS.

**Example URL:** https://www.example.com (uses HTTPS for security)

## 6. What is a Domain Name & DNS?

A Domain Name is a human-readable address that points to an IP address of a server (e.g., www.example.com).

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses to route internet traffic.

**Example:** www.example.com -> 93.184.216.34

## 7. What is Hosting and Deployment?

Hosting is the service of storing and making websites accessible on the internet via a server.

Deployment refers to the process of transferring files and applications to a server, making them available to users.

**Example:** Hosting can be done via services like AWS, and deployment can be done using CI/CD pipelines.
